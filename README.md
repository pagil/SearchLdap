SearchLdap project
==================

Description
-----------

This project was created to test Spring LDAP API.

To run the application you need LDAP server. Download and install Apache DS as described in this tutorial:
http://www.stefan-seelmann.de/blog/setting-up-an-ldap-server-for-your-development-environment

IMPORTANT: To complete the last step in the tutorial "Load some sample data", use the LDIF file available in the root folder of this project:
- /SearchLdap/import.ldif

The LDIF file uses the same structure as defined in the tutorial above and includes additional data retrieved from Oracle DB's HR database.
